## How to create a GitHub page?  
### Step 1: Head to your Pages tab of your repository settings  
This is located under the "Code and Automation" section on the left
### Step 2: Build the website  
First, select the branch that you want to build (in this case main), then click save.
### Step 3: Visit the live server link  
The link will be found on this same Pages tab. Click on it to visit your now deployed static page!  

## My Key Takeaways  
Despite already having prior experience with frontend design, CSS and styling are still somewhat tricky to get very perfect at. I also have realized the importance of semantic tags as a way to enforce separation between content and presentation.
